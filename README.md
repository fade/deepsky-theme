# deepsky-theme
an emacs colour theme that may be useful to hackers with dichromacy.

This colour set evolved over time. It works for me; it might work for
you. I find it easy on the eyes, and I can discern everything in
it. Added as a special bonus is the fact that it isn't completely
hideous to people with colour-normal vision. Feel free to send along
questions or comments.
